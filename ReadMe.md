Convert FiberWorks .dtx weaving pattern files to WIF 1.1

This software can also convert WeavePoint .wpo files to WIF, though it cannot read fiber thickness or spacing information, so the conversion loses information.

This runs as a command-line script written in Python. See Installation and Usage for instructions.

This package can also read .wif, .dtx, and .wpo files into a standard in-memory model (`dtx_to_wif.PatternData`).
This may be used for writing weaving design or loom driver software.
